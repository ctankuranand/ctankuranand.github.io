   	<strong> What is Tokyo?</strong>   Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, /ˈtoʊkioʊ/;[6] Japanese: [toːkʲoː] (About this sound listen)), officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to), is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan and has been the capital since 1869.[7][8] The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.[9] It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese government and the National Diet. Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.[10] Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city as his headquarters in 1603. It became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).

     <ol> <strong>Luxury lodgings, world-class restaurants and unexpected amusements </strong>
Tokyo is a sophisticated mix of upscale bistros, luxury hotels and corporate headquarters. Located close to the edge of the original Edo Castle, the area is now a grown-up destination for dining and shopping with a large share of Tokyo's Michelin-starred restaurants, and many of Tokyo's premier hotels. You can have fun here as well—explore the cobbled backstreets, discover the magic of Ninja Akasaka restaurant, and visit the hundreds of fox statues at Toyokawa Inari Tokyo Betsuin Temple.

<strong> Power spots and centers of power </strong>
Sitting next to the old Edo castle, Akasaka is home to princely mansions and powerful shrines. When it isn't hosting visiting world leaders, you can visit Akasaka Palace—also known as The State Guest House—built for the Crown Prince in 1909. It's an opulent building that resembles Buckingham Palace, with formal gardens and a Japanese-style annex.
